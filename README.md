# mouseshiver
## Intro
What does the application do?
Nothing useful what so ever, it will find the most appropriate input negate any noise associated with the microphone then shake your mouse depending on how loud the input to your microphone is. The idea was that this would be entertaining in games especially competitive ones where precision is key and once the individual is loud and tilted, the more inaccurate their aim will become.

## Variation
There are two variations of this application, one written in python which is a simple mouse simulation. There is another written in C++ which bypasses the restrictions of Raw input. 

## How to use
Download the variation that is applicable to you. If you require this in a game that doesn't allow the change of raw input please download the raw input override option, otherwise you can simply download the typical version. The override version requires C++ compiler as well as a python compiler to run if you wish to do it through the source code. If you require the ordinary version this only requires a python compiler.  
  
If you wish to download the executables you can simply go to the bin folder and download from the desired version. Then move all files to a folder. In regards to the ordinary version you can edit the YAML file to change the sensitivity to your liking whereas the override version doesn't yet have this functionality.  
  
In order to run the application open a command prompt by typing. "Ctrl + R" then type "cmd" navigate to the folder in which the executable is located in and run the executable through the command "./main.exe"
